## Features
* **Player Charges**: Add support for LIMITED, LOADING, and USES tags for systems and some weapons. This allows for proper tracking of resources on actor sheets, and if combat automation is enabled in the settings, then this will also tie into the combat roll workflow (Unloaded weapons can't be fired, etc.).
* **NPC Charges**: Add NPC sheet support uses and RECHARGE abilities. If combat automation is enabled, at the start of an NPC turn a Recharge roll will be made and report which systems made the roll, and automatically charge them.
* **Weapon Profiles**: Add profiles to weapons in tabs.
* **Action Manager**: First draft of the action manager. While controlling a token, a (movable) HUD will appear. If you've used Comp/Con's active mode, this will be very similar to the action bar at the bottom right. Currently actions need to be manually spent for actions (When done moving, click the move action button, etc.). The core workflows of the action system is there:
  * When starting a turn, a token's actions are refreshed.
  * When ending a turn, all remaining actions are wasted (minus Reaction, which is immediately refreshed at every turn).
  * When spending a Quick action and a Full action is available, the Full action is spent instead (represents the 2 Quick = 1 Full conversion).
* **Action Editing**: First draft of action editing on all manner of items, first step towards homebrew and ease-of-use UX.
* (0.9.1 but not documented) Right clicking weapon icons will toggle destroyed state. This will eventually be folded into a proper context menu.

# 0.1.0 (2020-07-19)
## Alpha release!
A huge thank you and shout-out to Animu36, Grygon, and Staubz, without whose help this initial release would have taken many more weeks!

The system is bare-bones, but should be stable for play. Features existing as of this release:
* Compendiums containing all of the Core Book player-side content.
* Pilot sheet with sorted Items, mount handling (thanks, Animu!), support for frame swapping by drag-and-drop, and some macro buttons.
* NPC sheet with support for class swapping by drag-and-drop (thanks, Staubz!), and some macro buttons.
* Editable sheets for each Item type (thanks, Grygon!):
  * Skill Triggers
  * Talents
  * Core Bonuses
  * Pilot Armor, Weapons, and Gear
  * Mech Frames
  * Mech Weapons
  * Mech Systems
  * NPC Classes
  * NPC Templates
  * NPC Features

## Recommended Companion Modules
* Lancer Condition Icons - status/condition icon sets tailored towards Lancer.
* Hex Size Support - Improves Hex grid snapping, movement, and ruler measurement for hex tokens larger than size 1.
* Popcorn Initiative - Add-on popcorn initiative management system.

## Known Issues
* Weapons, systems, and NPC features do not render all of their effects yet. Since the Compendiums are generated using `lancer-data` (the same data library that Comp/Con uses), the effects are broken down into the special types that Comp/Con supports. Implementing proper rendering and then editability for special effects types will be added soon. This may be delayed until the recently announced changes to the data are complete on the Comp/Con side.
* No NPCs included! As the Core Book NPCs are part of the paid content for Lancer, they cannot be included in the system upon install. An LCP import tool is coming, which will allow you to use the Comp/Con NPC pack (download from the [Core Book itch.io page](https://massif-press.itch.io/corebook-pdf)) to automatically build/update NPC Compendiums. For now, NPC stats will need to be entered manually.
* Does not include [Long Rim](https://massif-press.itch.io/the-long-rim) or Wallflower player content. Again, LCP import is coming!
